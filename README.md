# 🍕 JavaScript Pizzabot

Welcome to the **JavaScript Pizzabot** project! This is a beginner-friendly interactive program where users can order a virtual meal using only JavaScript. It covers the basics of variables, conditionals, prompts, and alerts.

## 🚀 What is this?

This project was built as part of a JavaScript introduction course. The goal is to practice plain JavaScript, focusing on user interaction and logical structures like `if`, `else`, and `prompt()` inputs.

The application simulates a food ordering system where the user selects:
- Their name
- A main dish (Pizza, Pasta, Salad)
- A subtype based on the dish
- If the meal is for a child or an adult
- Confirms their order

## 📂 Project Structure

- `script.js`: All JavaScript logic is written here

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- JavaScript (vanilla)

## 📚 What I Learned

- Using `alert()` and `prompt()` for user interaction
- Working with variables and storing user input
- Implementing conditional logic (`if/else`)
- Handling text case with `toLowerCase()`
- Providing user feedback through alerts
